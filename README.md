# datascript statechart architecture

Experimenting with a new architecture where all app state is stored in a Datascript DB 
and state transitions are modeled 
with Statecharts.


## Prototypes 

- 📄 [todo example](prototypes/todo-example)
  - basic todo application build with Datascript and statecharts
- ⌨️ [editor](prototypes/editor) (WIP)
  - basic clojurescript editor with hot swapping
- 🧐 [inspector](prototypes/viewer) 
  - inspect statecharts and views
  - will eventually be combined with editor
