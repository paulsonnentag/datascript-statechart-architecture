and state transitions are modeled 
with Statecharts.

## Prototypes 

- üìÑ [Todo example](prototypes/todo-example)
  - Todo application build with Datascript and statecharts
- ‚å®Ô∏è [Editor](prototypes/editor)
  - ClojureScript editor with hot swapping
- üßê [Inspector](prototypes/inspector) 
  - Inspect & edit statecharts and views
  - [Demo](http://datascript-statechart-app.surge.sh/) (Takes a while to load, because of bootstrapped Clojurescript)
